## Unit detail

### U001 — Runtime skeleton, pins, and `vsir doctor`

**Milestone:** M0 · **Spend:** none · **Status:** `[x]` Complete · **Completed:** 2026-09-09

**Demo output** — `vsir doctor && VSIR_VLM_MODEL=gemini-pro-latest vsir doctor; echo "exit=$?"`
(run after `set -a && . ./.env && set +a`; key lines, the full stream is 6 JSON events per
invocation):

```json
{"event": "doctor_ok", "failed_checks": [], "release_id": "dev-0", "python": "3.11.15",
 "models": {"VSIR_VLM_MODEL": "gemini-3.8-flash-001", "VSIR_EMBED_MODEL": "gemini-embedding-2"},
 "fingerprint": {"embed_model": "gemini-embedding-2", "dim": 1536, "distance": "cosine",
                 "composition_version": "d4-fused-v1"},
 "fingerprint_id": "45a09c588c25422c", "pages_collection": "vsir_pages_1536",
 "runs_collection": "vsir_runs", "dpi_index": 150, "dpi_answer": 220, "vlm": "stub", "level": "info"}
first-exit=0
```

```json
{"event": "boot_check_failed", "check": "model_ids_pinned", "level": "error", "release_id": "dev-0",
 "detail": "model id ends in -latest: VSIR_VLM_MODEL=gemini-pro-latest — pin the version (§4.3, F11)",
 "floating": {"VSIR_VLM_MODEL": "gemini-pro-latest"}, "suffix": "-latest"}
exit=1
```

`VSIR_EMBED_MODEL=gemini-embedding-latest` refuses identically. `bash scripts/test-unit.sh` →
**69 passed**, Layer 1 PASSED.

Container facts (`docker build -t vsir:dev-0 -f backend/Dockerfile backend`):

```
id            -> uid=10001(vsir) gid=10001(vsir)
--read-only   -> touch: cannot touch '/srv/x': Read-only file system
image config  -> user=10001 entrypoint=[vsir] cmd=[doctor]
in-image      -> python 3.11.16, doctor_ok, exit 0; with no env, doctor_refused, exit 1
```

**Invariants / failure rows closed:** **F11 (boot half)** — a resolved model id ending `-latest` is
refused at boot, named, non-zero (`test_doctor_refuses_latest_model_alias`, both model variables).
Spec §20.1 register item **B6** closed. No invariant is asserted at M0 (Spec §9 assigns none).

**Notes**

- **The three live-collection refusals of §4.3 are not here, by design.** Payload schema vs
  `INDEXED`, the collection fingerprint and `phrase_matching` on `text`/`vlm_codes` all read a live
  collection, and `core/indexed.py` is U003's deliverable — plan U003 says so explicitly
  ("`doctor.py` — **extended**: the `--create-collection` flag and the live-schema assertion").
  `doctor.BOOT_CHECKS` is the extension point: one ordered check list, run identically by the CLI
  and by server start (U014), so the two cannot drift.
- **All twelve Factor III variables are required, with no code-side default** — including
  `VSIR_PORT`, which §15 describes as "default 8000". U001's acceptance criterion is that unsetting
  any one of the twelve makes `doctor` exit non-zero naming it, and a default would defeat that. The
  port number itself is documented in `.env.example`.
- **The app does not read `.env`.** Loading a file from the working directory is the shape §15.2
  bans, so the operator loads it (`set -a && . ./.env && set +a`) and `docker run --env-file` does
  the same. `.env` was committed (empty) at init; it is now gitignored and untracked.
- **`VSIR_VLM_KEY`** is the VLM credential's variable name, required only when `VSIR_VLM=gemini` so
  replay mode (D10) runs in CI with no key. Named `VSIR_VLM_KEY` rather than `GEMINI_API_KEY` to keep
  the interface provider-agnostic and to keep the literal `api_key=` out of the tree, which is one
  of the §12.5 cloud-native greps U002 writes.
- **`VSIR_VLM_MODEL=gemini-3.8-flash-001` in `.env.example` is a shape, not a verified id.** §4.2
  names "the pinned id for Gemini 3.8 Flash" without giving the literal. Confirm the exact dated
  suffix against Google's model list before U013's paid ingest. Boot refuses a `-latest` escape
  hatch, so an operator cannot dodge the pin.
- **Two extra optional variables** beyond the spec's named set, both documented in `.env.example`:
  `VSIR_EMBED_DIM` (feeds the collection name and the fingerprint — §6.6) and
  `VSIR_RUNS_COLLECTION` (the D9 control plane).
- **`pytest-cov` added to `backend/requirements-dev.txt`** — test-only, and only because the
  existing `scripts/test-unit.sh` passes `--no-cov`, which pytest rejects as an unknown flag
  without it. Coverage stays off.
- **`scripts/test-unit.sh` does not forward `"$@"`,** so the plan's
  `bash scripts/test-unit.sh -k "doctor or json_log or sigterm_boot"` silently runs the whole
  suite. Harmless here (69/69 green, strictly stronger than the filter) — **U002 owns the fix**
  when it extends the script.
- **`impl` is at `/Users/sabesonk/Documents/VisionRag/dilmah-engineering-solutioning/poc/vision_segmentation_index_and_retrieval/impl`** —
  four levels up from this repo, not the three the build prompt states. U002 records it in
  `AGENTS.md`.
- **Local toolchain:** the machine's Python is 3.14 and the pin is 3.11, so the venv is
  `backend/.venv` built by `uv venv --python 3.11`. Activate it before the test scripts, which call
  a bare `python`. U002 records this in `AGENTS.md`.

## Notes

Record gaps, ambiguities and assumptions here as they are resolved.

### Open at planning time
- **OQ-1** pilot PDF location — blocks only U013's re-bill. Default: the operator places it at
  `data/source/TC1E-SF.pdf`; `data/source/` stays gitignored.
- **OQ-2** Gemini project/key — blocks the L4 halves of U013, U020, U022 and U026's real numbers.
  Default: replay mode (`VSIR_VLM=stub` + `VSIR_FIXTURE`), paid paths behind `VSIR_ALLOW_PAID=1`.
- **OQ-3 / OQ-7** Part A export hand-off (HTTP vs files on disk) — resolve before M8 (U011, U025).
- **OQ-5** one collection at 5,505-page scale — default one collection with `doc_id` scoping (U025).

### Stale spec text adjudicated during planning
See plan §8 SA-1…SA-12. The load-bearing ones: **SA-1** the dense vector **does** include the page
raster (C12/D4 win over §4.2's "Text only" row); **SA-2/SA-3** the sparse surfaces and RRF **ship**
(D2 wins over §2.2's out-of-scope row and §7.2.1's "there is no sparse vector" parenthetical);
**SA-4** the default answer route is `fetch`, not `read`.

### Spec changes made
None. Gap analysis found no true blocker — every apparent contradiction is resolved by Spec §2.3,
§3 or §17.

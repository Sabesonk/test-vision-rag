#   ./scripts/test-e2e.sh          full automated run (up → test → down -v)
#   ./scripts/test-e2e.sh --up     start stack only (for interactive Playwright MCP session)

# The suite never reaches a live model: the stack runs VSIR_VLM=stub against a frozen fixture
# (D10), so a UI assertion is deterministic and a run costs nothing.
